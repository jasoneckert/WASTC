Run the following commands in a new Terminal on your Fedora Workstation as root:

USERS & GROUPS
   less /etc/login.defs
   cat /etc/default/useradd
   touch /etc/skel/policies.txt
   su - woot (switches to a woot session – no password needed!)
   sudo useradd -m larry (enter woot’s password of Secret555)
   sudo useradd -m curly (sudo caches your previous authentication during the session)
   pkexec useradd -m moe (enter woot’s password of Secret555)
   exit	(returns you to your root session)
   passwd larry (enter Secret555)
   passwd curly (enter Secret555)
   passwd moe (enter Secret555)
   groupadd stooges
   usermod -aG stooges larry curly moe
   grep larry /etc/passwd (interpret the fields shown)
   grep larry /etc/shadow (interpret the fields shown)
   grep stooges /etc/group (interpret the fields shown) 
   passwd -l larry
   grep larry /etc/shadow
   passwd -u larry
   grep larry /etc/shadow
   chfn larry (supply some suitable values of your choice)
   grep larry /etc/passwd
   dnf install finger
   finger larry
   ls -a /etc/skel  
   ls -a /home/larry (note the contents are the same as /etc/skel and include policies.txt)
   su - woot
   groups (note that you are a member of the wheel group)
   sudo userdel larry (supply your password of Secret555 when prompted to confirm)
   su -	(supply the root user password of Secret555 when prompted)
   ls -la /home/larry (note that larry’s old UID owns existing files)
   useradd -m -u UID shemp (where UID is larry’s old UID)
   ls -la /home/larry /home/shemp (note that shemp owns larry’s old files)
   exit
   id	(note your UID & GID and that root is your primary group)
   touch firstnewfile
   ls -l firstnewfile (note the owner of root, and group owner of root)
   newgrp sys  
   id	(note your UID & GID and that sys is your primary group)
   touch secondnewfile
   ls -l secondnewfile (note the owner of root, and group owner of sys) 

PROCESSES 
   ps -ef | less (view the processes on your system)
   ps -el | grep Z (do you have any zombie processes on your system?)
   pstree (use [Shift]+[PageUp] and [Shift]+[PageDown] to navigate)
   top (press q to quit when finished)
   dnf install htop
   htop	(press F10 to quit when finished)
   ps (note the PID of your bash shell for the following commands)
   kill -2 PID (note that bash trapped the signal)
   kill -3 PID (note that bash trapped the signal)
   kill -15 PID (note that bash trapped the signal)
   kill -9 PID (note that the process was killed successfully - log back in as root afterwards)
   sleep 10 (note that you do not receive your prompt until sleep terminates)
   sleep 5000000& ; sleep 5000000& ; sleep 5000000&	
   jobs
   fg %3		
   [Ctrl]+c (this sends a 2/SIGINT kill signal to the foreground process)
   killall -9 sleep
   nice -n 19 ps -l (note the priority and nice values)
   nice -n -20 ps -l (note the priority and nice values)
   nice -n 11 sleep 50000& (note the PID for the next command)
   renice -5 PID
   exec ls (you were logged out after this command was run because you directed your shell to not fork() a subshell - log back in as root afterwards)
   at now + 1 minute 
      echo Hello World >>/testfile
      Press [Ctrl]+d
   cat /testfile (to this in about 1 minute to see the results)
   crontab -e (save your changes when finished - use https://crontab.guru/ to interpret when /bin/false is scheduled to run!)
      15  6   1-6  *  2  /bin/false
      20  21  1-6  *  2  /bin/false
   crontab -l 
   ls -F /proc/1 (this is the PID for the first daemon on the system)
   cat /proc/cpuinfo
   cat /proc/meminfo
   cat /proc/uptime
   cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
  
PRINTING 
   lpadmin -p p1 -E -v /dev/null -m raw  (creates a fake printer that prints to /dev/null)
   lpadmin -d p1 (sets the system default printer to p1)
   cupsaccept p1
   cupsdisable p1 (this holds print jobs in the print queue)
   lpstat -t
   less /etc/cups/printers.conf
   lp /etc/issue
   lpstat
   ls /var/spool/cups
   lpr /etc/issue
   lpq
   ls /var/spool/cups
   lpc status
   lpstat
   cancel p1-1 p1-2
   lpstat
   
   * Also explore the graphical CUPS admin tool in Firefox (http://localhost:631)

STORAGE
   ls -l /dev/sda* (note the block file type, major number and minor numbers)
   ls -l /dev/tty[0-6] (note the character file type, major number and minor numbers)

   * In the settings for your virtual machine, insert your Fedora ISO image into the virtual DVD drive. 
   * In the GNOME desktop, navigate to Activities > Files and note that your DVD is shown as mounted. 

   df -hT (note the standard partitions are mounted to /, /home and /boot, and DVD automounted to /run/media/woot/label) 
   lsblk (swap is not mounted) 
   ls /sys/block 
   less /proc/devices 
   ls /run/media/woot/label 
   umount /run/media/woot/label
   df -hT (verify that the virtual DVD is no longer mounted)
   mount /dev/cdrom /mnt (/dev/cdrom is a symlink to your CD/DVD device file)
   ls /mnt (note the DVD contents)
   fdisk /dev/sda 
      p 
      n 
      [Enter] 
      [Enter]
      p
      w
   partprobe 
   mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdan (where n is the partition number from fdisk)
   mkdir /data
   mount /dev/sdan /data
   lsblk
   cp -R /root/classfiles /data
   ls /data
   ls /data/classfiles
   df -hT
   umount /data
   pvcreate /dev/sdan (choose y to remove the existing ext4 filesystem)
   vgcreate vg00 /dev/sdan  
   vgdisplay (note the value next to VG Size in GB for creating LVs)
   lvcreate -L size -n data vg00 (where size is the VG Size from the last command)
   mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vg00/data
   mount /dev/vg00/data /data
   lvdisplay
   lsblk
   df -hT
   vi /etc/fstab (add the following line and save your changes)
      /dev/vg00/data   /data  ext4  defaults  0  0 
  reboot (after the system has booted, open a Terminal as root)
  lsblk (verify that the data LV is mounted)

  * In your virtualization software, add a second virtual hard disk to your Fedora Linux virtual machine (this will be /dev/sdb). 
  
  lsblk 
  fdisk /dev/sdb 
     n
     [Enter]
     [Enter]
     p
     w
  pvcreate /dev/sdb1
  vgextend vg00 /dev/sdb1
  vgdisplay  (note the additional space available in the vg00 pool)
  lvextend -L +size –r vg00/data (where size is the additional space)
  lsblk
  df -hT  (note that your /data volume is now much larger!)
  umount /data
  fsck -f /dev/vg00/data
  echo $? (note that you receive 0, which indicates that no other errors exist)
  mount /data (this works because of the line in /etc/fstab)
  cd classfiles
  mkisofs -RJ -o poems.iso Poems
  ls -l poems.iso
  mount -o loop -r -t iso9660 poems.iso /mnt
  lsblk
  df -hT
  ls /mnt
  ls -R /mnt
  umount /mnt

SERVER INSTALLATION
  * Install Ubuntu Server (if you have not already)
  * Open a Terminal as root on Ubuntu Server to run the following commands to examine the system configuration
  
  lsblk
  fdisk -l
  lvdisplay
  df -hT
  apt install net-tools cockpit
  systemctl start cockpit
  ifconfig (note your IP address)

  * On your Windows or macOS host computer, open up your Web browser and access your Cockpit console (https://IPaddress:9090)
  * Log into Cockpit as the root user, navigate the interface and note the configuration options.
