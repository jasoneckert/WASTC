Run the following commands in a new Terminal on your Fedora Workstation as root:

- Redirecting stdin, stdout & stderr
   df -hT >diskspace (we examine the df command later)
   date >>diskspace
   cat diskspace
   ls letter lett >good 2>bad
   cat good
   cat bad
   cp /etc/hosts ~
   cat hosts
   sort hosts >hosts
   cat hosts (the file is empty because the shell clears an existing file	before writing stdout to it with the > symbol)
   tr a A <letter >newletter
   cat newletter
   ls <letter	(ls runs normally because it does not accept stdin)

- Piping 
   cd classfiles
   grep -i mother letter | wc -l		
   cat letter | pr -d | less
   cat proposal1 | tr a W | sort | tee newfile
   cat newfile
   cat Poems/Shakespeare/sonnet* | wc -l
   grep -i love Poems/Shakespeare/sonnet* | wc -l

- Shell Variables
   VAR1="Hello World"
   echo $VAR1
   set | grep VAR1
   env | grep VAR1 (VAR1 is not shown, as it was not exported)
   export VAR1
   env | grep VAR1
   PS1='C:${PWD////\\\\}>  ' 
   cat ~/.bash_profile (on Fedora, it runs .bashrc first if it exists)
   cat ~/.bashrc (note the aliases for rm, cp and mv)
   exit (open a new shell as the root user)
   echo $VAR1 
   vi ~/.bashrc file (add the following lines, save and quit)
      export VAR1="Hello World"
      alias bye="echo Goodbye ; sleep 5 ; exit"
   source ~/.bashrc (so you don't need to open a new shell)

- Shell Scripts

- Text Tools, sed & awk
- Using Git
- The Z Shell (optional extra)
