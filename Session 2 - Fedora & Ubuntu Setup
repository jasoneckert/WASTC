     but you can instead use the native Hyper-V hypervisor on Windows. 
   - Refer to the free documentation on the hypervisor website to learn how to create a virtual machine using the hypervisor software.
3. In your hypervisor software, create a new virtual machine called Fedora Workstation that has 4GB of RAM, 64GB of virtual hard disk storage, 
   and a connection to the Internet via the network interface in your computer.
