Basic Usage:

   1. Power on your Fedora Workstation system. You are on the tty1 terminal viewing the gdm (graphical login).
   2. Switch between the other local command line terminals by using the appropriate key combinations ([Ctrl]+[Alt]+F2 through F6).
   3. Switch to tty3 and log in as the user root (# prompt in the bash shell). 
   4. Switch to tty4 and log in as the user woot ($ prompt in the bash shell). 
   5. Switch to tty1 and log into the gdm as the woot user to start the GNOME desktop environment. 
   6. Open a command line terminal by clicking Activities and typing Terminal. At the terminal, run the following commands:
       who
       su - root 
   7. Switch to tty3 and run the "tmux" command. 
   8. Press the [Ctrl]+b key combination and then type % to split your screen. 
   9. Press the [Ctrl]+b key combination and then type “ to split your screen in the opposite direction. 
   10. Run the "who" command and note that tmux runs all screens within the tty3 terminal. 
   11. Practice switching between these three screens by pressing the [Ctrl]+b key combination followed by a cursor key (up down left right). 
   12. Type "exit" within each of your screens to kill each bash shell, returning you to your original bash shell.
   13. Run the following commands to install the KDE Plasma Workspaces desktop environment:
        dnf groupinstall “KDE Plasma Workspaces”
        reboot
   14. After your system has rebooted, choose the Settings (cog wheel icon) menu in the gdm and select Plasma. 
   15. Complete your login as the user woot.
   16. Use the KDE start menu to locate the Terminal app to obtain a bash shell and run the who command. 
   17. Log out of the KDE desktop environment. 

Run the following commands in a new Terminal on your Fedora Workstation as root:

- Basic Shell Usage:
   date
   who
   w
   uname -a
   date;id;who
   echo We use the $SHELL shell
   echo 'You owe me $4.50'
   echo "You owe me $4.50"
   echo You owe me \$4.50
   clear
   reset
   wall "The system will reboot in 5 minutes"
   shutdown -r +5 minutes
   shutdown -c (cancels reboot)
   reboot

- Obtaining Command Help:
   whatis crontab
   man crontab (use q or [Ctrl]+c to quit out of any interactive utility)
   man 5 crontab
   man -k cron
   info crontab
   help | more
   help echo
   help help

- Navigating the Linux Directory Structure:
   pwd	(you should be in /root)
   cd /etc/sysconfig	(switches directory using absolute pathname) 
   pwd	(you should be in /etc/sysconfig)
   cd ../.. (switches to / using relative pathname)
   cd root	(switches to /root using relative pathname)
   cd ../etc/sysconfig	(switches to /etc/sysconfig using relative pathname)
   cd ~woot (takes you to woot’s home directory)
   pwd	(you should be in /home/woot)
   cd (takes you to your home directory, /root)	
   cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts (instead of typing this out, use the [Tab] key to autocomplete the path!)

- Viewing Directory Contents:
   cd classfiles 
   ls -F
   ls -l 
   file * (note the files empty and what_am_i).
   ls -l /dev | less 
   ls -l /run/systemd/journal/dev-log 
   stat /run/systemd/journal/dev-log 
   cd ; ls -a 
   ls -l classfiles/Poems/Shakespeare 
   ls -R classfiles/Poems 
   tree classfiles/Poems 

- Viewing the Contents of Text Files:
   cd classfiles 
   cat bigfile
   more bigfile (type h for help, q to quit)
   less bigfile (type h for help, q to quit)
   cat letter
   tail -8 letter
   strings letter
   od -x letter
   cat /etc/hosts
   cat Poems/Yeats/mooncat
   cat Poems/Shakespeare/* | less 	
   cat Poems/Blake/tiger
   head -1 Poems/Blake/tiger

- Common Text Tools:
   cd classfiles 
   grep "I " letter 
   grep -v "I " letter
   grep -i love Poems/Shakespeare/* (note the number of lines returned)
   wc -l Poems/Shakespeare/* (was Shakespeare a romantic?) 

- Editing Text Files:
   nano letter (note the legend with [Ctrl] key combinations)
   dnf install vim (installs the full version of vi improved)
   vimtutor (interactive vi tutorial, alternatively visit https://vim.is/#exercise)
   vi small_town (fix the numerous typos and formatting errors, saving your changes when finished)
   vi ~/.vimrc (add the line "set number" to turn on line numbering on by default)
